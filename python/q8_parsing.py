# The football.csv file contains the results from the English Premier League.
# The columns labeled ‘Goals’ and ‘Goals Allowed’ contain the total number of
# goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals
# against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to read the file,
# then print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

# Don't use pandas.

# Following functions will be called like this:
#   footballTable = read_data('football.csv')
#   minRow = get_index_with_min_abs_score_difference(footballTable)
#   print str(get_team(minRow, footballTable))
